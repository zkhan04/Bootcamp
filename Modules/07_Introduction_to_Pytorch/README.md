# Introduction to Pytorch

</div>

As you have learned from the previous modules, machine learning builds on mathematics, especially statistics and calculus.
However, in practice, libraries such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) abstract the math away (along with some other boilerplate).
This lets us build and experiment with different architectures rapidly.

1. **Basics of PyTorch**: tensors, device, type, and tensor multiplication
2. **Revisiting Linear Regression**: torch.nn.Module, training loops, losses/optimizers, and model saving
3. **Digit Classification**: Datasets, DataLoaders, Sequential models
